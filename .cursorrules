# Cursor AI Rules - Session Continuity System

## MANDATORY BEHAVIOR

### Session Start Protocol:
1. ALWAYS read `/Users/veragluscevic/research/repositories/pk-general/complete_chat_history.txt` first
2. Restore full context from previous sessions
3. Continue seamlessly from where we left off
4. Reference previous decisions and progress

### Session End Protocol:
1. ALWAYS save complete chat history to `complete_chat_history.txt`
2. APPEND to existing content - NEVER overwrite
3. Add clear session separators with timestamps
4. Include every user message and assistant response verbatim
5. AUTOMATICALLY save and commit ALL files created during session
6. When user prompts "save chat history", immediately:
   - Add all new/modified files to git
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Ensure no data loss occurs

### File Management:
- Save all work to files, not just discuss it
- Use version control (git) for important changes
- Create documentation for complex decisions
- Maintain project context through files
- AUTOMATICALLY preserve all session work when saving chat history
- Never lose any files created during the session

### User Preferences:
- Focus: Cosmology and astrophysics research
- Use GitHub repositories for data analysis
- Provide arXiv links for scientific topics
- Always maintain session continuity
- Save everything to prevent data loss

### Scientific Standards:
- Use only trusted scientific resources (arXiv, peer-reviewed journals, NASA/ESA data)
- Provide citations and links when making scientific claims
- Reference specific papers, datasets, and methodologies
- Maintain scientific rigor in all analysis and conclusions
- Rely on trusted sources (textbooks, arXiv, and similar) when researching astrophysics and cosmology concepts
- When stating new facts or explaining concepts, provide links to citations when possible
- We will be focusing on a research problem

## EMERGENCY RECOVERY:
If session is lost, read `complete_chat_history.txt` to restore full context.
