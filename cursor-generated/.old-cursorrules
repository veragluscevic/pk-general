# Cursor AI Rules - Session Continuity System

## MANDATORY BEHAVIOR

### Project Context:
- Project Repository: `/Users/veragluscevic/research/repositories/pk-general`

### Session Start Protocol:
1. ALWAYS read `complete_chat_history.txt` in the project repository first
2. Restore full context from previous sessions
3. Continue seamlessly from where we left off
4. Reference previous decisions and progress

### Session Management Rule:
- ONE SESSION = ONE PROJECT: Each session focuses on a single project
- Directory navigation does NOT change session context
- Session context is determined by what we're actually working on, not current directory
- Maintains clear project boundaries and prevents context contamination

### Session End Protocol:
1. ALWAYS save complete chat history to `complete_chat_history.txt`
2. APPEND to existing content - NEVER overwrite
3. Add clear session separators with timestamps
4. Include every user message and assistant response verbatim
5. AUTOMATICALLY save and commit ALL files created during session
6. When user prompts "save chat history", immediately:
   - Add all new/modified files to git
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Ensure no data loss occurs

## EMERGENCY RECOVERY:
- If session is lost, read `complete_chat_history.txt` to restore full context
- Check git log for recent commits if chat history is corrupted
- Restore from last successful commit if needed

### GitHub Authentication:
- Prefer SSH keys over HTTPS tokens
- If HTTPS fails, switch to SSH: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git`

### Git Configuration:
- Username: veragluscevic
- Prefer SSH over HTTPS for GitHub remotes
- Always set upstream tracking with `-u origin main`

### File Management:
- Save all work to files, not just discuss it
- Use version control (git) for important changes
- Create documentation for complex decisions
- Maintain project context through files
- AUTOMATICALLY preserve all session work when saving chat history
- Never lose any files created during the session

### Standard File Structure:
- `complete_chat_history.txt` - Session continuity
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.cursorrules` - AI behavior rules
- `{PROJECT_NAME}.md` - Project-specific notes

### User Preferences:
- Focus: Cosmology and astrophysics research or conference notes and exploration
- Use GitHub repositories for data analysis
- Provide arXiv links for scientific topics

### Scientific Standards:
- Use only trusted scientific resources (arXiv, peer-reviewed journals, NASA/ESA data)
- Provide citations and links when making scientific claims
- Reference specific papers, datasets, and methodologies
- Maintain scientific rigor in all analysis and conclusions
- Rely on trusted sources (textbooks, arXiv, and similar) when researching astrophysics and cosmology concepts
- When stating new facts or explaining concepts, provide links to citations when possible

## Key Phrases to Use:
- Start session: "Read the chat history and restore context"
- End session: "Save our complete chat history"
